- Added the bulk edit feature in the Swipe assignment repository. With this feature User can update multiple invoices at a time.
- Inorder to add the feature created two files. 1. BulkEdit.jsx and 2. Editable Invoices.

## Other Issues

While going through the code I found that InvoiceModal.jsx has some missing data. When debugging this I found two spelling mistakes in the file.

1. TaxAmmount ---> TaxAmount
2. DiscountAmmount ---> DiscountAmount

Thank You.
